During 2020's Spring Festival üß®, due to [the outbreak of __2019-nCoV__ in Wuhan, China]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019‚Äì20_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak)), I have to stay at home and read some books.

I plan to finish this book during this vacation.
